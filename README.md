# Solar-Power-Cover-Analysis
Data analysis using  Machine learning  techniques

Deep Solar is a comprehensive high-fidelity solar deployment database for the contiguous U.S that is based on the machine learning framework.
The data being used in this analysis is a subset of the Deep Solar database, that is a solar installation database for the US, built by extracting information from satellite images and the photovoltaic panel installations are identified based on the analysis of several satellite image tiles.
We will be applying different machine learning models for predicting the power coverage in the form of solar panel count on the basis of satellite imagery data.
World is undergoing a transformation towards a cleaner energy network and therefore the use of Solar panels is a great way to offset energy costs, reduce the environmental impact and contribute to energy independence along with tax credits and rebates.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, solar generated $17 billion in investments for the U.S. economy in the year 2018-19.
